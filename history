        2006-Sep-28 version 0.24b - beta 1 build 3
        -------------------------
        - SRAM segment is now always created. I have partly
          reverse engineered a game which uses SRAM to store
          some flags, although there is SRAM available
          in the cartridge. (Maybe I should grab some more up
          to date documents on the NES?)


        2006-Sep-22 version 0.24b - beta 1 build 2
        -------------------------
        - inf.filetype is not set anymore (deprecated).
          get_loader_name() will be used instead for a
          possible bank switching plugin to determine the
          filetype
          

        2006-Sep-21 version 0.24b - beta 1
        -------------------------
        - when a corrupted NES image is detected, a dialog box
          is shown, asking the user whether to fix the header or
          not
        - store_chr_rom_pages() and store_prg_rom_pages() are fixed
        - sourcecode restructured / added prototypes for every function
        - added convenience functions, making the source more readable
        - renamed all "store_..." functions to "save_..._as_blob()"
        - fixed a memory leak in save_trainer_as_blob()
        - save_ines_hdr_as_blob( ines_hdr *hdr) changed to
          save_ines_hdr_as_blob( void )
        - load_chr_rom_bank() is more verbose (reminder ;)
        - load_trainer() is more verbose
        - entrypoint is set to RESET_VECTOR_START_ADDRESS
        - moved mapper enum and char *mapper_names[] to mappers.h
        

        2006-Sep-19 version 0.23b - beta 1
        -------------------------
        - fixed a bug in get_vector()
        - removed vector_t
        - removed v_ constants from nes.h
        - vector comments are removed
        - GNROM mappers don't seem to load the first two
          PRG pages, they now load the first and the last.
          I probably should get a more up to date document
          on mappers
        - segments are now patchable, this means the file
          offset is shown below IDA's disassembly as well
        - added fix_ines_hdr()
        - added mapper names and helper function get_mapper_name()
        

        2006-Sep-18 version 0.21b
        -------------------------
        - added PPU RAM layout to nes.h
        - fixed bug in load_chr_rom_bank()
        - temporarily "disabled" load_chr_rom_bank(), PPU is
          not fully supported, yet
        - renamed some functions
        - commented the code a bit more


        2006-Sep-15 version 0.20b
        -------------------------
        - removed load_prg_rom_pages() and load_chr_rom_pages()
        - added load_prg_rom_bank() and load_chr_rom_bank()
        - added identifiers for some mappers
        - began adding support for known mappers by
          implementing load_rom_image(), which is a wrapper
          for load_prg_rom_bank() and load_chr_rom_bank().
          ROM images with known mappers should now correctly
          be loaded
          

        2006-Sep-14 version 0.17b
        -------------------------
        - source code has been restructured
        - all relevant NES/ROM segments are now created,
          but not all segments are being initialized.
          expansion rom segment is always created.
        - ioregs.h has been added to the project
        - I/O registers are now named and commented,
          the disassembly is now pretty readable!
        - added store_trainer(), store_prg_rom_pages()
          and store_chr_rom_pages() - those functions
          store (together with the already available
          store_ines_hdr() function) the whole original
          file inside the IDA database. This allows virtual
          bank/page swapping as well as output file generation
          from an external plugin.


        2006-Sep-12 version 0.16b
        -------------------------
        - vectors are now commented with their respective file offsets.
          This is useful for "hooking" vectors (trainer development etc.)


        2006-Sep-11 version 0.15b
        -------------------------
        - trainers are supported (tested on my own trainer
          that I've coded for a game today - it patches
          the NMI vector to jump to $7000 - where trainers are mapped to.
          I don't know about other trainers, since I haven't seen
          any trainers "in the wild".


        2006-Sep-10 version 0.14b build 2
        -------------------------
        - fixed is_corrupt_ines_hdr()
        - loading of CHR ROM pages is currently limited
          to loading the first CHR ROM page at CHR_ROM_START_ADDRESS
        - added add_entry_points() and name_vectors()
        - added void create_sram_page(), SRAM virtually
          supported, but untested


        2006-Sep-09 version 0.14b
        -------------------------
        - added sanity checks
        - nes.h: added vector_t
        - nes.cpp: renamed get_reset_vector() to
          get_vector()
        - IRQ and NMI routines are now exported as
          entrypoints (public names) as well

    
        2006-Sep-08 version 0.13b
        -------------------------
        - added get_reset_vector() : entrypoint now equals
          the address of the reset vector (stored inside
          the last PRG ROM page?!)
        - load_prg_rom_pages() temporarily loads a maximum
          of two pages - possibly until all mappers are
          supported
        - changed load_prg_rom_pages() and load_chr_rom_pages()
          to temporarily create nonpatchable segments


        2006-Sep-03 version 0.12b
        -------------------------
        - added a check for corrupted iNES headers
        - added a check for presence of a trainer
        - added INES_MASK_... macros to nes.h
        - added dumpidb.idc to package


		    2006-Sep-02 version 0.11b
		    -------------------------
		    - added support for CHR-ROM pages
		    - ROM image is now completely loaded
		      into IDA so it can be reassembled
		      (in theory, I didn't have the chance
		      to try it yet)
		    - trainers are not supported yet as
		      I don't have any ROM images containing
		      trainers
		    - commenting, code cleanup and bugfixes.

		    2006-Sep-01 version 0.1b
		    ------------------------
		    - initial version
