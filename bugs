	known bugs:
	-----------

    - if ROM images are not aligned properly (see nes.h),
  	  the loader won't load the ROM correctly. Also, if
	    actually less pages than given in the iNES header
	    are present in the ROM, the loader will fail.
	    I am too lazy to fix this at the moment.
	    It doesn't make sense to disassemble corrupt ROM images
      anyway ;)

    - the loader doesn't initialize RAM
    
    - exp rom is not supported yet

    - not all mappers have been tested, please email me if
      you experience any problems

	  - swapping banks is not supported, this will most probably
      be done with a plugin.

    - nmi, reset and irq vectors aren't checked to be within
      PGR rom area - this isn't a must, but it could detect
      modified, patched or invalid ROM images.

    - if both SRAM and a trainer are present, the loader
      only creates an SRAM segment (the trainer is mapped
      to a part of the SRAM segment)
      

    Please send me an e-mail if you find any bugs or have
    suggestions for improvements!
